Linear Regression Model to Predict Prices of Houses

##  Project Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on:
- Square Footage (GrLivArea)
- Number of Bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr)
- Number of Bathrooms (FullBath)

The model was trained and evaluated using the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

- Google Colab

---

##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Handling missing values
4. Train-test split (80-20)
5. Model training using Linear Regression
6. Model evaluation using MSE and R² score

---

##  Model Performance
- R² Score: 0.63
- The model explains approximately 63% of the variance in house prices using selected features.
